## Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) with GitHub Actions on AWS ECR and ECS

#### Project Description:

This project is a streamlined, automated deployment framework designed to simplify the process of deploying containerized applications in AWS using GitHub Actions, Docker, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This project aims to provide a seamless CI/CD pipeline that ensures efficient and reliable delivery of applications from code to production.

#### Key Features:

1. **Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions**:
   - Automate the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions.
   - Trigger workflows on code commits, pull requests, and merges to maintain code quality and integrity.

2. **Containerization with Docker**:
   - Build and manage containerized applications using Docker.
   - Ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.

3. **Secure Image Storage with Amazon ECR**:
   - Push and store Docker images securely in Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
   - Manage and retrieve container images for deployment with versioning and access controls.

4. **Scalable Deployment with Amazon EKS**:
   - Deploy and manage applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.
   - Leverage Kubernetes orchestration for scaling, self-healing, and high availability.

5. **Automated Deployment Pipeline**:
   - Define and automate deployment pipelines to EKS clusters.
   - Use GitOps principles to maintain version control and track changes in deployment configurations.

#### Benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline reduces manual intervention and speeds up the deployment process.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications with Kubernetes orchestration on EKS.
- **Security**: Secure container image management with Amazon ECR.
- **Reliability**: Automated testing and deployment ensure consistent and reliable application delivery.
- **Visibility**: GitHub Actions provide clear visibility into the build and deployment processes through logs and status checks.
